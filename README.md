## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

The idea of Your Thrift Co. comes from a love of vintage and thrift shopping. In this day and age there is so much propaganda and popularity around sustainability and ethical fashion, in that people are simply trying to consume less or being more conscious consumers. Fast fashion is definitely taking a back seat with so many sustainable and ethical brands coming up. Although this is not the most affordable way to shop, especially when consumers have limited budgets. That is where buying pre-loved, second hand items is very popular. Whilst there are physical thrift shops all around the world, and all around Australia, online shopping is taking precedence. Whilst in USA and UK there are a selection of pre-loved clothing online marketplaces, Australia seems to have been left behind with not a lot available for use within Australia or simply without enough Australian users for it to operate at full potential. That is where the idea Your Thrift Co. came to be. An online pre-loved, second-hand clothing/item marketplace started in Australia. Of course the idea of expanding to world-wide in future is there, there is a gap in the market for an Australian owned and operated thrift marketplace. Initially the application is targeted towards Women, with the plans for expansion in future.

## 	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

As aforementioned sustainable and ethical fashion is not only very popular these days, but it is an important issue. In fast fashion the ethical side is that employees and their working conditions are most of the time not ideal, in fact can be inhuman. So consumers today are not wanting to support as many fast fashion brands, as being conscious of ethical practices is becoming more widespread. 

Sustainability is also a very important quality more consumers are wanting to adopt. According to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/fast-fashion-environmental-impact-pollution-emissions-waste-water-2019-10?r=US&IR=T) the equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothing is burned or dumped in landfill every second, with 85% of textiles produced going into landfill every year, which is enough to fill the whole of Sydney Harbour every year. Additionally according to [Edge Expo](https://edgexpo.com/fashion-industry-waste-statistics/), only coming second to oil, the clothing and textile industry is the largest polluter in the world. That is just a small snippet of large amounts of statistic to do with the fashion industry. That is why if consumers are willing to lessen there environmental impact by trying to be more sustainable and conscious with consuming, it has the potential to do a lot of good. 

Your Thrift Co. will enable consumers another platform to buy second, and sell secondhand. Reuse, reduce, recycle.

## Description of your marketplace app (website), including:

### Purpose

The purpose of Your Thrift Co. is to be an online thrift/pre-loved/second-hand clothing platform, enabling users to register and be able to sell there own items or buy other users items. The initial application is set up directed at Women as that is the market thrift shopping is more popular in, however if the application were to be as successful as planned, expanding to the Male market would be in future. 

The core design of the application also will enable Users to interact like a form of social media, just with a basis around fashion. As trends today are not just set by brand, but via individuals, so with the features of commenting and liking items also allows social interaction via our platform. So whilst some Users will operate with the intention of having just a closet clear out, other Users can operate the platform as a form of online business. The ability to build a following of users that will come to buy their particular items. 

Another notable purpose of the application is the ability for users to, in a sense, operate a business from their bedroom. Part of the target purpose is users wanting the ability to shop secondhand online, however the other part of the target purpose is the users ability to sell their pre-loved items online. 

### Functionality / features
